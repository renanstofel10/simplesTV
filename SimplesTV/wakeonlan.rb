# In order for this to work, first go to the TV "General" settings and turn on "Mobile TV On".

# Change this to the actual value.
# First find the TV IP, e.g. from your router's list of connected devices.
# Then run "arp -a" on a computer and you'll see the MAC by its IP.
# Maybe you need to "ssh <the ip>" before it will turn up in arp. Not sure.
